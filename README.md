# World-Economic-Data-Analysis-and-Insights
Creating Data Visualization and Dashboards to better understand the Global Economic scenario.
Overview
This project uses data visualization and analytics to offer a comprehensive view of the global economic landscape. Through interactive dashboards, we highlight critical economic indicators, trends, and projections to support organizations in making informed, data-driven decisions. With this resource, companies can explore options for portfolio diversification, and governments and institutions can gain insights into the challenges faced by both developing and developed nations. By focusing on essential metrics like GDP per capita, corruption, standard of living, and unemployment, our visualizations provide clear and actionable insights to drive sustainable development. Using tools like IBM Cognos, we create visually engaging charts, graphs, and maps to simplify complex economic data for decision-makers.

Novelty / Uniqueness
Our solution stands out by not only analyzing the data but also employing advanced tools to detect patterns and trends, offering a deeper, multidimensional view of the global economic context. Unlike many existing solutions that center on single-variable time series analysis, our approach incorporates complex metrics like debt ratio, inflation, and tourism to offer a unique perspective. By exploring these often-overlooked areas, we aim to provide insights into policy impacts and regional economic correlations on a global scale. Additionally, our project assesses economic risks, delivering long-term trend analysis and evaluating competitive advantages and weaknesses across various regions and industries.

Business / Social Impact
This project is a valuable resource for businesses aiming to identify economic opportunities, and it can also support educational and research purposes. It enables us to pinpoint areas or populations experiencing economic challenges and develop targeted programs to address poverty and promote financial inclusion. The project ultimately seeks to inform business strategies, shape government policies, enhance social welfare, and foster global collaboration.
